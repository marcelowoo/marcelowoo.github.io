Welcome to my website! I am an Economics PhD candidate at the University of Nottingham. I work on organizational economics, discrimination, and behavioral economics, using tools from theory and causal inference. 

I am available for interviews in the 2025/26 Job Market. You can reach me at marcelo.woo1[at]nottingham[dot]uk[dot]ac.
