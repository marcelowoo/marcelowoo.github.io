Welcome to my website! 

I am an Economics PhD candidate at the University of Nottingham. Prior to the PhD, I worked in industry for 7+ years.

I work on behavioral economics topics, specializing in the economic consequences of non-standard formation of beliefs and processing of information, applied to labor markets, businesses, and organizations. In my research, I employ microeconomic modeling, as well as empirical tools such as experiments, causal inference, and machine learning. 

<!-- My research interests center around the economic consequences of non-standard belief formation and information processing, in labor markets and organizations, using a combination of theoretical modelling and causal inference. -->


I am available for interviews in the 2025/26 Job Market. You can reach me at marcelo.woo1 [at] nottingham [dot] uk [dot] ac.
