Welcome to my website! 

I am an Economics PhD candidate at the University of Nottingham, with 7+ years of work experience in industry.

I work on behavioral economics topics. I specialize in the economic consequences of the non-Bayesian formation of beliefs and processing of information, applied to labor markets, businesses, and organizations. In my research, I employ microeconomic modeling, as well as empirical methods such as experiments, causal inference, and machine learning. 

<!-- My research interests center around the economic consequences of non-standard belief formation and information processing, in labor markets and organizations, using a combination of theoretical modelling and causal inference. -->


I am available for interviews in the 2025/26 Job Market. You can reach me at marcelo.woo1 [at] nottingham [dot] uk [dot] ac.
