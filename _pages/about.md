Welcome to my website! I am an Economics PhD candidate at the University of Nottingham. Prior to the PhD, I worked 7+ years in tech firms.

My research centers around behavioral economics topics. I study the economic consequences of decision-making based on non-standard belief formation and information processing, especially in the domains of labor markets, businesses, and organizations. In my research, I employ microeconomic modeling, as well as empirical methods such as experiments, causal inference, and machine learning.
