  title={Power Decarbonization in a Global Energy Market: The Climate Effect of U.S. LNG Exports},
  abstract={Investment in clean power depends on the price of internationally traded fossil fuels. To what extent can major fossil fuel exporters like the U.S. influence global electricity decarbonization through their trade policy? To answer this question, I develop and estimate a dynamic, multi-country model of power asset investment, where the carbon intensity of electricity generation is affected by the entry and exit of plants using alternative fuels and the local price of fossil inputs is determined in a global trade equilibrium. Using this model, I assess the climate impact of granting federal approval to all proposed U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) export terminal projects, which would double U.S. export capacity by 2030. Results indicate a net decrease in global emissions through 2070, primarily due to higher local gas prices in the U.S., leading to lower domestic gas generation and accelerated renewable adoption. In the rest of the world, short-term emissions fall as reliance on coal drops, yet delayed renewable uptake drives long-term emissions up. Combining the LNG expansion with carbon policies in importing countries substantially boosts carbon savings. Conversely, reverting LNG capacity to baseline by 2050 shows little impact, underscoring the risk of carbon lock-in in settings with long-lived infrastructure.},

  title={Heads in the Sand: Theory and Experiment on Information Avoidance in Groups},
  abstract={Information avoidance is well-documented in individual decision-making. People may steer clear of useful information that could lead them to better outcomes, even when it's freely available. In many situations, including global warming, infectious diseases, or a company's success, individual outcomes are not independent but are correlated with those of others. This paper explores information avoidance in a group context, where individual decisions impact the whole group. If more individuals remain ignorant, the outcome in the bad state of the world becomes worse for everyone. In this context, the risk of contagious ignorance looms large. If people are more likely to avoid information when their peers do, the group may end up trapped in an equilibrium where nobody acquires information, with potentially dire consequences. We design and run a novel experiment that studies information avoidance in groups. In the aggregate, we find that information avoidance increases when people think that avoidance is prevalent among their peers, in line with contagious ignorance. Data collected through the strategy method, however, reveals substantial heterogeneity at the individual level. About 20\% of our subjects behave in accordance with contagious ignorance, while another 20\% exhibit the opposite tendency: they become more likely to acquire information when others avoid it. Overall, the data suggest that contagious ignorance is a real phenomenon which can, however, be circumscribed by appropriate group design.},

  abstract = {We examine patterns of discrimination when employers hold incorrect beliefs about the relationship between group membership and productivity, and suffer from confirmation bias when updating their beliefs. As a result, employers do not correct them fully, leading to persistent wage discrimination. Negative stereotypes generate discrimination against minority workers upon entry to the labor market, but are not enough to have discrimination in the long run, and reversals in discrimination are possible. We also discuss whether interventions aimed at reducing discrimination would succeed if confirmation bias is an important source of discrimination, and consider segregation in an extension with heterogeneous employers.},
