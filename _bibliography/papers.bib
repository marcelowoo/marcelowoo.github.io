  title={Heads in the Sand: Theory and Experiment on Information Avoidance in Groups},
  abstract={Information avoidance is well-documented in individual decision-making. People may steer clear of useful information that could lead them to better outcomes, even when it's freely available. In many situations, including global warming, infectious diseases, or a company's success, individual outcomes are not independent but are correlated with those of others. This paper explores information avoidance in a group context, where individual decisions impact the whole group. If more individuals remain ignorant, the outcome in the bad state of the world becomes worse for everyone. In this context, the risk of contagious ignorance looms large. If people are more likely to avoid information when their peers do, the group may end up trapped in an equilibrium where nobody acquires information, with potentially dire consequences. We design and run a novel experiment that studies information avoidance in groups. In the aggregate, we find that information avoidance increases when people think that avoidance is prevalent among their peers, in line with contagious ignorance. Data collected through the strategy method, however, reveals substantial heterogeneity at the individual level. About 20\% of our subjects behave in accordance with contagious ignorance, while another 20\% exhibit the opposite tendency: they become more likely to acquire information when others avoid it. Overall, the data suggest that contagious ignorance is a real phenomenon which can, however, be circumscribed by appropriate group design.},

  abstract = {We examine patterns of discrimination when employers hold incorrect beliefs about the relationship between group membership and productivity, and suffer from confirmation bias when updating their beliefs. As a result, employers do not correct them fully, leading to persistent wage discrimination. Negative stereotypes generate discrimination against minority workers upon entry to the labor market, but are not enough to have discrimination in the long run, and reversals in discrimination are possible. We also discuss whether interventions aimed at reducing discrimination would succeed if confirmation bias is an important source of discrimination, and consider segregation in an extension with heterogeneous employers.},
